        <h3>Special Containment Procedures:</h3>
        <p>Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive containment, a certain level of secrecy is
            necessary
            regarding the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The following procedures are required
            not
            for personnel safety, but to deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the personnel who interact
            with
            it.</p>
        
        <ol> <!-- Ordered list -->
            <li>: All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified Class VI BNC
                suits. Before personnel are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material SCP-006B
                or
                SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is restricted to only those with O5 clearance. To
                ensure
                personnel are wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles
                spotted
                signify a leak in the suit.</li>
            <li>: Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance. In case of contact with
                SCP-006,
                the commander in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have been briefed to
                believe
                to mean high toxicity is present and they must evacuate.</li>
            <li>: Any procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be approved by three (3) O5 level
                personnel.
                The liquid is to be transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.</li>
            <li>: If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid from SCP-006, they are to be
                confined
                and terminated after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the most effective
                termination method is incineration. (For full report, see file SCP006-TerO5)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its existence
            since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of the
            spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under
            Foundation
            and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral
            water in 1902, but has the unusual property of "health".</p>
        <p>Ingesting the liquid produces the following properties in human beings: the ability to regenerate DNA damaged
            by
            sufficient duplication, heightened excitement of cellular duplication, vastly improved abilities in the
            repair
            of damaged tissue, and a frightening increase in the effectiveness of the human immune system. Upon testing
            the
            liquid on animal subjects, hostile bacteria and viral agents were destroyed immediately. Many reptiles and
            birds
            were unaffected, while higher primates experienced the same benefits as humans.</p>
